## Contributing

Pull Requests are welcome! The item should be 
specifically applicable to medical physics. E.g. `numpy` doesn't count.
For libraries and applications, the project should be meant to be used by others;
a set of scripts that might be interesting does not count.
The item must have documentation of some sort on how to use it.
